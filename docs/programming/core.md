# Core Hoon

Hoon is strict, typed functional programming without category
theory.

Hoon is named after a Wallace Stevens poem.  Coincidentally, it
means "hooligan" in Australian.  Practically, "Hoon" is a short
punchy name which search engines handle well.

Hoon has simple principles and a lot of details.  To keep the
details from getting overwhelming, we start out learning a
simplified subset called Core Hoon.  (Note that some of the
internal structures we show are simplified to match the subset.
These simplifications are corrected under Advanced Types.)
