# Core Hoon

Hoon is strict, typed functional programming without math.

Hoon is named after a Wallace Stevens poem.  Coincidentally, it
means "hooligan" in Australian.  Practically, "Hoon" is a short
punchy name which search engines handle well.

This manual defines a practical Hoon subset we call Core Hoon.
Some of the internal structures we present are simplified to
reflect the Core subset.

To read it for the first time, read these links in order:

The Core manual is as terse as possible and written from a
top-down reference perspective.  This will suit some and not others.  For a
more narrative, bottom-up analysis, read [Deep Hoon](deep).
