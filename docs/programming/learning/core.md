# Core Hoon

Hoon is strict, typed functional programming without math.

Hoon is named after a Wallace Stevens poem.  Coincidentally, it
means "hooligan" in Australian.  Practically, "Hoon" is a short
punchy name which search engines handle well.

This manual defines a practical Hoon subset we call Core Hoon.
(Some of the internal structures we present are simplified to
reflect the Core subset.)

To read it for the first time, read these links in order:

Once you've been through all this material, you can try some
[exercises]() if you feel you're ready, or read [Deep Hoon]() for
a more narrative introduction.
