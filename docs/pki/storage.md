# Cryptographic Storage

We've moved our public-key infrastructure to the Ethereum blockchain. This means
that Urbit ship-holders need to generate and secure Ethereum addresses
network, and so on. We are using a Type 1 chain of Type 2 hierarchical
deterministic (HD) wallets to mirror the affordances of ownership and proxy
rights. Our HD wallet solution is described in detail in
[this Urbit Proposal](https://github.com/urbit/fora-posts/blob/master/proposals/posts/~2018.11.8..19.31.59..ba77~.md)
