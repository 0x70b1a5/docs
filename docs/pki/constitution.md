# Constitution

The [Urbit Constitution](https://github.com/urbit/constitution) is a suite of smart contracts that manage the rules and ownership of the Urbit address space.

Note: As of `~2018.11` these contracts are still being tested. In the future â€” Urbit will depend on these contracts to track ownership of Urbit assets.
