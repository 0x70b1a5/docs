# Getting started

On disk your urbit is an append-only log and a checkpoint.  Or, in simpler terms, a directory where we keep your urbit’s state.  We call this a ‘pier’.

## Initialize

To create an urbit, we must make a pier and assign it an identity. An urbit with an identity is a 'planet', if it was generated by a 'star' (an urbit that makes more urbits. Accordingly, a 'galaxy' is an urbit that makes stars).

To make a planet, you need a ticket from a star. If you have a ticket, like `~fortyv-tombyt-tabsen-sonres`, start your planet `~fintud-macrep` like so:

    $ bin/urbit -w fintud-macrep -t fortyv-tombyt-tabsen-sonres

This will create a directory `fintud-macrep/` and begin building your urbit. Assembling a planet may take a few minutes.

If you do not have a ticket, you can still make a 'comet', a parentless urbit drifting thorugh cyberspace. You can specify any name you like.

    $ bin/urbit -c comet

This will create the directory `comet/` and generate a 64-bit identity for your urbit.

## Orientation

When your urbit is finished booting you should see a `dojo>` prompt.  Welcome!  

By default your urbit is quite bare-bones.  Let's stroll through what's already running:

### Shell — `:dojo`

The command prompt in front of you is a simple shell and Hoon REPL.  Let's make sure it works:

    ~fitund-macrep:dojo> (add 2 2)

Should produce:

    > (add 2 2)
    4

Good.

### Messaging — `:talk`

Use `^X` (ctrl-x) to change your prompt.  Let's join the main Urbit chat channel:

    ~fitund-macrep:talk() ;join ~doznec/urbit-meta

`:talk` is stateful, so your urbit will download a backlog.  `/urbit-meta` is the place to ask questions, get help and talk about anything Urbit-related.

### Web — `:tree`

Urbit is also accessible through the web.  Try opening:

    http://localhost:8080/

in your favorite browser.  You'll be prompted to use `+code`.  This page was generated by `:tree`, the basic Urbit web interface.  You can also access your urbit through `http://fintud-macrep.urbit.org` (where `fintud-macrep` is your planet name).  

### Filesystem — `%clay`

`%clay`, the Urbit filesystem, isn't mounted to unix by default.  Switch to the `:dojo` prompt and run:

    ~fitund-macrep:dojo> |mount %

This should produce:

    > |mount %
    >=

which indicates the command was processed.

`|mount %` will cause a `home/` directory to appear inside your pier folder.  Changes to these files are automatically synced into your urbit.

With your urbit up and running, you know enough to start learning to program:
