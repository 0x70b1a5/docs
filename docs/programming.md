# Programming

Urbit's programming language is called Hoon.  It's a strict,
typed functional language without category theory.  Hoon is not
closely related to any older language. 

Hoon is named after a Wallace Stevens poem.  Coincidentally, it
means "hooligan" in Australian.  Practically, "Hoon" is a short
punchy name which search engines handle well.
