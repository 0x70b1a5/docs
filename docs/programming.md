# Programming

Most people should start by [learning Hoon](programming/hoon).  If you're a
madman and just want something fun fast, skim the Hoon docs, then go to [Arvo
systems programming](programming/arvo/system).  If you're interested in the
theory, learn [Nock](programming/nock) first; otherwise, learn it last.
