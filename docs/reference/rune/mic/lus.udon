# `;+ "miclus"`

make an XML node (Sail)

## Produces

A noun that represents a single XML node.

## Syntax

*1-fixed*

```
;+  p=hoon
```

`p` is a Hoon expression.

## Discussion

This is a Sail rune.  Sail is a part of Hoon used for creating and operating on nouns that represent XML nodes.  Among other things it can be used to generate a static website using the appropriate render pipeline.  See the [Sail tutorial](../../../../tutorial/sail).

In Sail you can produce a single `<p>` node very simply in the following way:

```
> ;p: This will be rendered as an XML node.
[[%p ~] [[%$ [%$ "This will be rendered as an XML node."] ~] ~] ~]
```

One interesting thing about Sail is that it allows you to use complex Hoon expressions to choose from among several nodes to render.  This is done with the `;+` rune.

## Examples

```
> ;+  ?:  (gth 3 2)
        ;p: This is the node for 'yes'.
      ;p: This is the node for 'no'.
[[[%p ~] [[%$ [%$ "This is the node for 'yes'."] ~] ~] ~] ~]

> ;+  ?:  (gth 2 3)
        ;p: This is the node for 'yes'.
      ;p: This is the node for 'no'.
[[[%p ~] [[%$ [%$ "This is the node for 'no'."] ~] ~] ~] ~]
```
