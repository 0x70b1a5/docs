# `|^ "barket"`

Produce a core whose battery includes a `$` arm and compute the latter.

## Syntax

Regular:

```
|^  a=hoon
++  b=term  c=hoon
++  d=term  e=hoon
       ...
++  f=term  g=hoon
--
```

Note: The `++` rune may be replaced with any other rune in the `+` family.

AST:

```
[%brkt p=hoon q=(map term tome)]
```

## Semantics

A `|^` expression produces a multi-arm core whose battery includes a `$` arm, which is evaluated immediately.  `a` is a Hoon expression that defines the product of the `$` arm.  `a` is followed by a series of arm definitions for the rest of the core battery arms.  There must be at least one arm other than the `$` arm.

## Expands to

```
=>  |%
    ++  $  a=hoon
    ++  b=term  c=hoon
    ++  d=term  e=hoon
           ...
    ++  f=term  g=hoon
    --
$
```

## Discussion

The `|^` rune is useful when you define a multi-arm core in your code and a particular arm in it is to be evaluated immediately.

## Examples

A trivial example:

```
~zod:dojo> |^
           (add n g)
           ++  n  42
           ++  g  58
           --
100
```
