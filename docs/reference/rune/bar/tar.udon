# `|* "bartar"`

`[%brtr p=spec q=hoon]`: produce a wet one-armed core with sample.

## Expands to

```
=|  p
|%
+-  $
  q
--
```

## Syntax

Regular: *2-fixed*.

## Discussion

In a normal (dry) gate, your argument is converted into the
sample type.  In a generic (wet) gate, your argument type
passes through the function, rather as if it were a macro (there
is still only one copy of the code, however).

Genericity is a powerful and dangerous tool.  Use wet gates only if
you know what you're doing.

Just as with a [gate](../tis), we can recurse back into a wet gate
with `$()`.

> `$()` expands to `%=($)` (["centis"](../../cen/tis)).

## Examples

Wet and dry gates in a nutshell:

```
~zod:dojo> =foo |=([a=* b=*] [b a])

~zod:dojo> =bar |*([a=* b=*] [b a])

~zod:dojo> (foo %cat %dog)
[6.778.724 7.627.107]

~zod:dojo> (bar %cat %dog)
[%dog %cat]
```

The dry gate does not preserve the type of `a` and `b`; the wet
gate does.
