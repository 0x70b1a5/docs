# Hoon syntax

Hoon's semantics are simple, but unusual.  Hoon's syntax is
complex, and unusual.  Sorry.

An excuse: the normal human brain doesn't have hardware support
for math, but it does have hardware support for syntax.  Learning
math is harder than it looks.  Learning syntax is easier.

An explanation: the Hoon syntax is trying to solve three serious
problems in functional syntax design.

Read the [motivation](motivation) if you care; or go straight to
the actual [design](design).
