</div>

Go to the [technical overview](about/overview) for a high-level
architecture description.  To install and run Urbit, read forward from the
[installation guide](using/install).

To begin developing for Urbit, start by learning Hoon [syntax](hoon/syntax), 
then walk through the [Arvo tutorials](arvo). The examples and exercises 
in Arvo will teach you to build high-level programs and interact with the network. 

Dig into the mechanics of Urbit with [Core Hoon](hoon). Refer back
there for pure-code exercises and functions in the [standard library](hoon/library). 

Registered academics are required to start with the [Nock definition](nock/definition)
and work upward from there.
