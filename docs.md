Go to the [technical overview](about/overview) for a high-level
architecture description.  To install and run Urbit, read forward from the
[installation guide](using/install).

To begin developing for Urbit, start by [learning Hoon](hoon). Refer back
there for pure-code exercises and functions in the [standard library](hoon/library). 
When you have a feel for Hoon's basic structure and [syntax](hoon/syntax), 
you're ready to write apps in Urbit with the [Arvo tutorials](arvo). 

Registered academics are required to start with the [Nock definition](nock/definition)
and work upward from there.
