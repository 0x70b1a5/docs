**Comets** are urbits whose names are 128-bits or 16 syllables, such as:

`~hillyn-pitwet-hasdur-paswer--miszod-rabpex-divrup-fogdur`

Comet names aren't quite as memorable as others, but they're disposable identities that anyone can make for free to join the live network.

## Booting a Comet

To boot your comet, go into the command line and run the following command from the directory that was created during Urbit installation:

```
$ urbit -c mycomet
```

This will take a few minutes and will spin out a bunch of boot messages. Toward the end, you'll see something like:

```
ames: on localhost, UDP 31337.
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321

```
