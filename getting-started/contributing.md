We accept submissions for improving our [code](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/) and [documentation](https://github.com/urbit/docs/) alike.

If you're looking to get involved, there are a few things you can do:

- Join the [urbit-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!forum/dev) mailing list.
- [Ask us about Hoon School](mailto:support@urbit.org), a course we run to teach the Hoon programming language and Urbit application development.
- Check out the "good contributor issues" tag in the [urbit](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/labels/good%20contributor%20issue) and [arvo](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+contributor+issue%22) Github repositories.
- Reach out to [support@urbit.org](mailto:support@urbit.org) to say hi and ask any questions you might have.

If you're getting set up to work on the Urbit or Arvo code base for the first time, start with our [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started/_index.md) guide, then have a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the Urbit repository.

Many contributors start by contributing to the [documentation](https://github.com/urbit/docs), [urbit.org](https://github.com/urbit/urbit.org), or [bridge](https://github.com/urbit/bridge). If you're not yet comfortable with Hoon, we recommend starting there.

If smart contracts (Solidity) are more your jam, have a look at [Azimuth](https://github.com/urbit/azimuth), Urbit's identity layer.

## Code style 

Before contributing Hoon code, you should familiarize yourself with the [Hoon style guide](./docs/learn/hoon/style.md). For a good example of idiomatic Hoon, see [ford.hoon](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/master/sys/vane/ford.hoon).
