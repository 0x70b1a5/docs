# Using Azimuth

The primary way to interact with Azimuth, our identity platform, is through our application [Bridge](https://github.com/urbit/bridge) and the node libraries that it depends on, azimuth-js and keygen-js. Take a look at the source and play around or see [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started).
