Welcome to the documentation for the Urbit project, including the Azimuth identity layer, the Arvo operating system, and the Hoon programming language. This documentation is maintained by [Tlon](https://tlon.io) in a public [Github repository](https://github.com/urbit/docs). Issues and contributions are welcome.

## Getting Started

The following three guides will help get you started on Urbit.

### [Install Urbit](/using/install.md)

Urbit isn't ready for serious use yet, but it's available to try out. If you have an Urbit identity, you can follow this step-by-step guide to get your point's _keyfile_, which you need to boot your ship. Then you can install Urbit and join the community.

### [Operator's Manual](/using/operations/_index.md)

The Operator's Manual will show you how to perform everyday functions on your Urbit.

### [Developer's Guide](/using/develop.md)

This guide will teach you how set up an Urbit development environment.

## Documentation

The documentation proper is contained on the sidebar of this page. It's meant for those interested in development on Urbit, and it's sorted by section:

- [Concepts](concepts) gives an in-depth, high-level explanations of Urbit concepts.

- [Tutorials](tutorials) contains tutorials all the details about the system, enough where you can develop on Urbit. There are sections on Arvo, the Urbit OS; Hoon, Urbit's functional programming language; Nock, the the low-level language Hoon compiles to; and Vere, the Nock interpreter that acts as the layer between Urbit and whatever system (MacOS, Linux, BSD) is running it.

- [Reference](reference) contains technical reference documentation for Hoon and other components of the system. Keep reading if you need to look up a Hoon expression or a standard-library function.
