Welcome to the documentation for the Urbit project, including the Azimuth identity layer, the Arvo operating system, and the Hoon programming language. This documentation is maintained by [Tlon](https://tlon.io) in a public [Github repository](https://github.com/urbit/docs). Issues and contributions are welcome.

## Getting Started

The following three guides will help get you started on Urbit.

### [Install Urbit](/install)

Urbit isn't ready for serious use yet, but it's available to try out. If you have an Urbit identity, you can follow this step-by-step guide to get your point's _keyfile_, which you need to boot your ship. Then you can install Urbit and join the community.

### [Operator's Manual](/operations)

The Operator's Manual will show you how to perform everyday functions on your Urbit.

### [Developer's Guide](/develop)

This guide will teach you how set up an Urbit development environment.

## Technical Documentation

The documentation proper is contained on the sidebar of this page. It's meant for those interested in development on Urbit, and it's sorted by section:

- [Arvo](../arvo) is the Urbit operating system. If you're interested in finding out about the architecture of the system, check out this section.

- [Azimuth](../arvo) is the Urbit identity layer. To use Urbit, you need an identity that is secured by Azimuth.

- [Hoon](../hoon) is the functional programming language used to build Urbit. This section contains tutorials that will help you build proficiency in the language.

- [Nock](../nock) is the low-level language Hoon compiles to. If you want to understand that absolute fundamentals of Urbit, this section will be of help.

- [Vere](../vere) is the Nock interpreter that acts as the layer between Urbit and whatever system (MacOS, Linux, BSD) is running it.
